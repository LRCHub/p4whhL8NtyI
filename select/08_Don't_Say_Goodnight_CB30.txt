It's almost 1 AM
And we're doin' all we can
To not let this Friday end
'Cause every time I'm with you, all I really wanna do is

Let you lay your pretty head up on my shoulder
Losin' track of time in my Toyota
In the radio glow
Makin' up reasons to keep us from leavin'
And tell me every little secret that you're keepin'
Every single feelin' that you're feelin'
Keep actin' like we don't
Know that the truth is that they're all excuses
To stay here together while we're wearin' out the leather seats
Say anything to keep me from turnin' the key
You can talk about whatever you'd like
But, baby, just don't say goodnight

Put your Nikes up on the dash
Go 'head, pull your hair on back
Tell me all your fears and the dreams you have
Fallin' for your eyes until the sun is risin'

Baby, let me let you lay your pretty head up on my shoulder
Losin' track of time in my Toyota
In the radio glow
Makin' up reasons to keep us from leavin'
And tell me every little secret that you're keepin'
Every single feelin' that you're feelin'
Keep actin' like we don't
Know that the truth is that they're all excuses
To stay here together while we're wearin' out the leather seats
Say anything to keep me from turnin' the key
You can talk about whatever you'd like
But, baby, just don't say goodnight

Goodnight
Ooh-ooh
Don't say goodnight, no

Baby, let me let you lay your pretty head up on my shoulder
(On my shoulder)
Losin' track of time in my Toyota
In the radio glow
Makin' up reasons to keep us from leavin'
And tell me every little secret that you're keepin'
Every single feelin' that you're feelin'
Keep actin' like we don't
Know that the truth is that they're all excuses
(You know they're all excuses)
To stay here together while we're wearin' out the leather seats
Say anything to keep me from turnin' the key
You can talk about whatever you'd like
But, baby, just don't say goodnight

Just don't say, don't say goodnight (Goodnight, goodnight)
No, please don't say, don't say goodnight (No)
No, baby, don't say, don't say goodnight, no

Just don't say, don't say goodnight
No, please don't say, don't say goodnight
No, baby, don't say, don't say goodnight, no
