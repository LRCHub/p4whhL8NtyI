The sign says "do not touch" - you're out of bounds
You're forbidden fruit, don't come around
It says don't make plans 'cause on your hand
Is a promise made to another man
'cause when you're around my defenses go down
Feelings get stronger, looks get longer
The closer you come, the weaker I get
If it ain't happened now, just ain't happened yet
[Chorus:]
So please, please, please go
I'm not strong enough to say no
Please, please don't stay
I'm not man enough to walk away
Please, please pass by
I can't resist you even though I try
So please go, I'm not strong to say no
The sign says "slow down-slippery ice"
You got dangerous curves, don't think twice
It says, "not for sale," your spoken for
Just take your heart and walk out the door
'cause when you're around my defenses go down
Feelings get stronger, looks get longer
The closer you come, the weaker I get
If it ain't happened now, just ain't happened yet
[Repeat chorus]
Don't say I didn't warn you, don't say you didn't know
Don't wait 'til it's too late and then try to go
The closer you come, the weaker I get
If it ain't happened now, just ain't happened yet
I'm beggin' you
[Repeat chorus]
