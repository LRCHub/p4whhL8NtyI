I watched you walk into, walk in this bar tonight
Don't know what it was but you caught my eye
Could have been that kiss-me smile
Could have been those heart broke eyes
But it's written all over your face, you're here alone tonight

And I don't see anybody else in here but you and me

And there was something 'bout the way you sounded when you said my name for the very first time
And the taste of your kiss when you put it on my lips
It was sweeter than strawberry wine
He must've done you so wrong
'Cause I can't even think of anything you haven't done right
You were so good at hello, I didn't even think you knew how to say goodbye

Go on tell me what he did
I don't mind listenin'
Girl, we've got all night
Don't care how long it is
'Cause that clock is moving slow
But if we run out of time
I've got a Chevy truck sitting outside

And I don't see anybody else in here but you and me tonight

And there was something 'bout the way you sounded when you said my name for the very first time
And the taste of your kiss when you put it on my lips
It was sweeter than strawberry wine
He must've done you so wrong
'Cause I can't even think of anything you haven't done right
You were so good at hello, I didn't even think you knew how to say goodbye

Could have been that kiss-me smile
Could have been those heart-broke eyes
Yeah, girl, he must have done you wrong
You got good in moving on (you got good in moving on)

And there was something 'bout the way you sounded when you said my name for the very first time
And the taste of your kiss when you put it on my lips
It was sweeter than strawberry wine
He must've done you so wrong
'Cause I can't even think of anything you haven't done right
You were so good at hello, I didn't even think you knew how to say goodbye

(Oh how to say goodbye) (goodbye)
(How to say goodbye)
(Didn't even think you knew how to say goodbye)
