Never saw it coming, never seen nothing like it
Kinda like a drug I didn't need 'till I tried it one night
Now I want it all the time
Only thing on my mind yeah it drives me crazy
Gave you my heart even though we both knew you would break it
It ain't right
Oh but I can't lie

You get me every time
We go out in style
Before that smoke clears
Leaves a high that loves to hang around here
You can put me through hell if it's a hell of a time
No I don't mind it baby
Long as it takes, I'll be right here waiting
On the same mistake I keep making
Cause I'll do it again
I wanna do it again
Baby just say when

Know that I'm just a guy that you dial when you've had too much
When you're broken down from another breakup
Just when I think I'm not falling in the same old trap
Keep coming back 'cause just like that

You get me every time
We go out in style
Before that smoke clears
Leaves a high that loves to hang around here
You can put me through hell if it's a hell of a time
No I don't mind it baby
Long as it takes, I'll be right here waiting
On the same mistake I keep making
Cause I'll do it again
I wanna do it again
Baby just say when
Just say when

Get me every time
We go out in style
Before that smoke clears
Leaves a high that loves to hang around here
You can put me through hell if it's a hell of a time
No I don't mind it baby
Long as it takes, I'll be right here waiting
On the same mistake I keep making
Cause I'll do it again
I wanna do it again
Baby just say when
Just say when

No it never ends
Baby just say when
Never saw it coming
Never seen nothing like it
Kinda like a drug I didn't need 'till I tried it
One night, now I want it all the time
